### Leg 1 Shubin - Eager
92.3 km

Bondus comments: There is a massive very rocky crater to the left most of the way, it has canyons nearby as well. Stay away! There are some canyons a few kms from Shubin, it should be possible to find a decent route past those. There are small craters near Eager. 

### Leg 2 Eager - Talon
125km

Bondus comments: First few km are a quite rocky. Then it's flat and nice rest of the way with minor obstacles.

TBD

### Leg 4 Echelon - Hasgaha
125km

TBD

### Leg 5 Hasgaha - Wolf

Bondus comments: The last 10-15 km is in mountans. It's possible to drive without big drops/cliffs, quite rocky.
